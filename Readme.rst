Relay Search
============

Relay Search, formerly known as Atlas, is a web application to discover Tor
relays. It provides useful information on how relays are configured along with
diagrams about their past.


Running it
----------

Some browsers might allow you to directly open the index.html file in the
repository's root directory. If that does not work, you have to use a web
server to run atlas.
