with graphs about their past.</p>

  <p>The aggregated search tool displays aggregated data about relays in the
Tor network. It provides insight into diversity in the network and the
probabilities of using relays in a particular country or AS as a guard, middle
or exit relay. The results are restricted to only currently running relays and
do not include bridge data.</p>

  <p>You can search for Tor relays and bridges by using keywords. In
particular, this tool enables you to search for (partial) nicknames (e.g.,
“moria”), IP addresses (e.g., “<a href="#search/128.31.">128.31.</a>”), and
fingerprints (e.g., “<a href="#search/9695DFC3">9695DFC3</a>”).  It is also
possible to combine searches, e.g., “<a href="#search/moria%20128.31.">moria
128.31.</a>”. Finally, you can use qualifiers to search for relays in specific
countries (e.g., “<a href="#search/moria%20country:us">moria country:us</a>”),
with specific contact information (e.g., “<a
href="#search/contact:arma">contact:arma</a>”), or with specific flags (e.g.,
“<a href="#search/flag:Authority">flag:Authority</a>”).</p>
  <p>If you are searching for a bridge, you will need to search by the hashed
fingerprint. This prevents leaking the fingerprint of the bridge when
searching. You can find this in the <code>hashed-fingerprint</code> file in the
Tor data directory. On Debian systems, this is in <code>/var/lib/tor</code> but
may be in another location on your system. The location is specified as
<code>DataDirectory</code> in your <code>torrc</code>.</p>
